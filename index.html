      <h2>How we should be developed to help PTSD people </h2>
      <img src=" ppphm.jpg" alt="" class="responsive">
      <p> As you know there is no cure for Ptsd but through therapy we can help adjust to their daily life and make a little better than previous.</p>
<p> how to make ptsd patients feel better first and foremost  for many PTsd survivors stated people looking down them and treating them different made them feel lonely and depressed try to treat ptsd equal but when say equal there a limitation but if there depressed  best to report it.</p>
<p> most ptsd patients tend to hold it in and not let anyone see how they feel trying to cut off their feelings trying to repress but ptsd can but repress  talking with family member and therapy  can help. </p>
