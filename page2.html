  <h1>letter to Mr Morgan Freeman</h1>
  <p>First and foremost I would like to thank for you time.The topic that we are to discuss is not an easy one. As you know, PTSD is not only seen in war. Americans here are struggling to barely live. We need the help and image of someone of your
    status to alert people that PTSD doesn't just go away. It takes time and help to overcome this obstacle,and to overcome your worst fears and experiences. It takes patience and medication.I know that you served in military. You can understand
    some
    of what I am saying to see a friend or a brother injured or scarred by this disease. Itâ€™s not easy on the love ones and the patient especially.
  </p>
  <p>There isn't an age for trauma. Did you know that know that 70 percent of adults have experienced trauma and out those 70 percent 20 percent develop PTSD. People who have experienced PTSD most of the time been have let down and have the sense
    of
    helplessness that there is no one there to help and that it doesn't get better . People with PTSD suffer everyday. We couldn't understand how they feel. They relive that trauma over and over again. </p>
  <p>We need your help more than ever to show and tell how we can avoid and help the people suffering from this disease.Our organization helps survivors of PTSD to overcome their obstacles and pays all exclusive vacations to help the patient go to
    meditation canoeing, fishing and other things to help them slowly overcome the past for one week.But in order for us to advance we need to be known, we need people to know what PTSD is and we need awareness so that people can be fully aware and
    their eyes opened to the sad truth of PTSD.

    Sincerely,
    P.T.S.D
